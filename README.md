Before you run the project be sure the DB is working and run on port localhost:4000.<br>
<br>
The project took me a five full work days, which is around 40hours in sum.<br>
BUT, before I even start it, I have spent around 3 weeks studying the React as I didn't<br>
have much knowledge about this technology.<br>
For this month I have studyed lots of usefull thing, such as: <br>
1) How to fetch Data using Apollo Client from GQueryDB<br>
2) How to use Styled Components<br>
3) Some of Cycles of ReactJS LifeSycle<br>
4) Found out that React doesn't like images from your device and you should require them to use it properly<br>
5) How to work with Class Components<br>
6) How to work with this.state<br>
7) How to uplift and drop props between components<br>
8) Basics of React-Router manipulations and so else, so on. <br>
<br>
For me it was a long road to finish this project, I was about to quite it almost every last five days.<br>
The problems and bugs was haunting me and I couldn't help myself, but still I was trying my best and finished it <br>
even not in a full month, maybe in a 27 days))<br>
<br>
There are some of photos of it:<br>
