Before you run the project be sure the DB is working and run on port localhost:4000.<br>
<br>
The project took me a five full work days, which is around 40hours in sum.<br>
BUT, before I even start it, I have spent around 3 weeks studying the React as I didn't<br>
have much knowledge about this technology.<br>
For this month I have studyed lots of usefull thing, such as: <br>
1) How to fetch Data using Apollo Client from GraphQL DB<br>
2) How to use Styled Components<br>
3) Some of Cycles of ReactJS LifeSycle<br>
4) Found out that React doesn't like images from your device and you should require them to use it properly<br>
5) How to work with Class Components<br>
6) How to work with this.state<br>
7) How to uplift and drop props between components<br>
8) Basics of React-Router manipulations and so else, so on. <br>
<br>
      Also some special features which had to be performed:<br>
      1) Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart - on the cart page itself, PLP and PDP should be provided.<br>
      2) For products that have various options (attributes) - the options should be selected.<br>
      3) The selected options of added to cart products should be visible in cart overlay and in cart page.<br>
      4) If an attribute is a swatch attribute (type = swatch), a representation of the value should be rendered on PDP and PLP,<br>
         rather than text description (e.g. the color itself, not "Blue" or "0000FF").<br>
      5) Filtering products by category name for all of the categories from BE.<br>
      6) The descriptions provided in HTML format should be parsed and presented as HTML, not as plain text.<br>
      7) Ability to change the currency of the store to one of the available currencies.<br>
      8) CURRENCY SWITCHER:<br>
            a. Currency Switcher list should close on click outside the component.<br>
            b. Currency Switcher icon should change on currency select.<br>
            c. Currency Switcher items should be highlighted.<br>
            d. Currency Switcher should close on currency select.<br>
      9) Cart item total quantity badge on the cart icon should display the total cart item quantity not the cart item count.<br>
      10) Add a product to the cart with first selected attributes as defaults. <br>
      11) Possible to add the same product to the cart with different attributes.<br>
      12) Product with same attributes can stack in the cart, while a product with different attributes appears as separate cart items.<br>
      13) Product brand and product name are joined together and rendered on the same line.<br>
      14) Cart Overlay has a scrollbar.<br>
      15) Arrows are visible only when there are multiple images in CartPage.<br>
<br>
For me it was a long road to finish this project, I was about to quite it almost every of each last five days.<br>
The problems and bugs was haunting me and I couldn't help myself, but still I was trying my best and finished it <br>
even not in a full month, maybe in a 27 days))<br>
<br>
There are some of photos of it:<br>
